<h1 id="Holistic_Learning_VS_Rote_Memorization"><strong>Holistic Learning VS Rote Memorization</strong></h1><p>Holistic learning is the opposite of rote memorization.  Instead of learning through force, your goal is to create webs of information that link together.<br><a id="more"></a><br><code>Rote Memorization</code></p>

<h1 id="Creating_a_Construct"><strong>Creating a Construct</strong></h1><p>Your goal when learning anything is to create a <strong>construct</strong> or an underlying understanding.</p>
<p>When you are being taught a subject or you are learning it on your own, you are getting bricks fed to you one by one.  If your lucky you might have a rough blueprint of how to organize the bricks, but if there aren’t enough linkages or they are assembled improperly the result is confusion.</p>
<p>The first key to building a house is to realize that’s what you are trying to do.  Your goal when learning any complex subject or field should be to build a construct.  A framework of understanding in which your web of knowledge occupies.  </p>
<p>I take very few notes in classes and I study them even less.  <strong>My goal in every class is to build a construct not to transcribe what was said.</strong>  Taking notes can be helpful but realize that is only an intermediate tool to your greater goal.  Having a workable construct.</p>
<p>Even if the building consisted of over a million bricks, <strong>a quick scan would show where the hole in the building lay and where the missing brick could be found.</strong></p>
<p>You don’t need every brick to maintain the structural integrity of a house.  <strong>You don’t need every piece of information to maintain the integrity of your understanding.</strong>  When you have a construct, you can solve difficult problems even when there is a lot of missing information.  You simply look at your construct, see where the holes point to and fill them in.</p>
<p><strong>As long as you have a relatively stable construct, you can find ways around the missing information.</strong> When one path gets shut down you take a different route.  When I take a test I can usually find a way to solve the problem even if I forget the method I was taught.</p>
<h1 id="Start_With_a_Model"><strong>Start With a Model</strong></h1><p>Constructs are formed from <strong>models</strong>, chunks of understanding that aren’t completely<br>accurate but can be used to solve problems.</p>
<p>A model is not the same as a construct. A construct is a complete set of understandings. A construct for math allows you to solve any problem in math.</p>
<p>A model is a quick representation of the idea you are trying to relate or understand.  <strong>It is an incomplete and temporary solution.</strong>  Without building a dozens of models any attempts to form a construct will collapse.  Trying to understand everything at once is impossible for the conscious mind to handle. Building individual models can give you a chance to stitch them together into a complete construct.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently I took a course in Vectors and Linear Algebra.  A very abstract course where most people have difficulty forming a construct.  When the concept of a subspace was introduced, I was lost.  I needed a construct for the concept, but it was too broad to immediately grasp.  So I looked for a model.</p>
<p>The model I chose was a visual representation of what I figured an idealized subspace might look like.  I imagined a subspace as being a plane suspended in three dimensions.  The visualization was as vivid as  it was automatic.  I can remember the plane being red and translucent slicing through a blue-gray vacuum of three dimensional space.</p>
<p>This model was not a construct.  A plane in 3D is just one of many different types of subspaces.  But without it, a subspace would have just been a bunch of rules and numbers.  Even if the model was inaccurate, I could use it as a basis for refining and expanding the eventual construct.</p>
<p>Links form into simple models which form into overall constructs.  Layered creations of understanding.  Effective constructs also link outside of where they are applicable.  Once I had a construct prepared for subspaces, I started to view my own experience as a subspace of reality. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Constructs that become islands are worthless when there is a problem that exists between them.  Interlinking your constructs helps funnel problems outside of their influence zone into realms of understanding.  </p>
<h1 id="How_to_Learn_Holistically"><strong>How to Learn Holistically</strong></h1><p><strong>When I need a model, I find one.  When I have enough models I form a construct.When I learn information I try to link it within and outside my constructs.When I learn information I try to link it within and outside my constructs.</strong></p>
<p>You create webs of information, constructs and models by <strong>visceralizing</strong>, <strong>metaphor</strong> and <strong>exploring</strong></p>
<h2 id="Visceralization"><strong>Visceralization</strong></h2><p>A model isn’t a grouping of ideas, it’s an experience.</p>
<p>The best “visceralizations” are combinations of images, sounds, feelings and textures.  Depending on your learning preference you may see, hear or feel ideas.  More than just a picture, you want an experience.</p>
<p>If you aren’t sure exactly how to do this, the best place to start is with a pad of paper.  <strong>Draw out the relationship between several ideas in a picture</strong>.  Remember your goal isn’t a perfect construct but a simplified model.  Even if your model is shown to be slightly inaccurate later, it is still better than no model at all.</p>
<p>Ask yourself what the concept would look, sound or feel like?  How would it function and respond?  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When learning computer science I formed mental pictures of bizarre machines and objects that represented the different objects and functions I learned.  Strings and arrays looked like colored cubes suspended along a cord.  Functions were machines that ate strings and individual blocks and spat out new blocks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you get better you should be able to do this without a pencil and paper.  Your imagination is far faster than your hand, so once you begin to understand the process you can start visceralizing how different concepts interact.  You can see how they squish and respond to stimuli.  Boring ideas translate into a bizarre and otherworldly scene.</p>
<h2 id="Metaphor"><strong>Metaphor</strong></h2><p>To interlink constructs you need to use metaphor.<br>Metaphor is a literary term used <strong>when you want to relate two things that aren’t actually related.</strong></p>
<p>If you wanted to build a house, the fastest way would be to make minor modifications to a blueprint you already own.  Metaphors can allow you to relate a new construct to a previously established one.  This can help you piece together ideas when your models fail to give accurate information.</p>
<p>If you don’t already use metaphors extensively, <strong>a quick way to start would be to play the, “That Reminds Me Of…” game whenever you learn something new.</strong>  You play the game by thinking or writing down a list of ideas that this new concept reminds you of.  It doesn’t matter if the ideas are ridiculous or completely unrelated.  That’s the point, to link together ideas that don’t normally connect.</p>
<p>The idea is that by playing this game repeatedly you can see the new concept through the vantage points where you already have understanding.  This helps you understand more rapidly.</p>
<p>If you already understand sports, then you can use sports as a metaphor when trying to comprehend economics or science.  You can create connections between any subjects you just need to be patient enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I read Nicollo Machiavelli’s, The Prince, I started linking his ideas about statecraft (which were a rather weak construct for myself) and built them into ideas about business and social settings (which were strong constructs).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Explore"><strong>Explore</strong></h2><p>Exploration is the process of going through your constructs, models and metaphors and finding errors. </p>
<p>Holes and errors will only come up when you actually go back and test them. Until you  actually review the information involved, they will be hidden from your awareness.  This happens when you go to write an exam and you realize you don’t know how to solve a specific problem or you don’t have the right formula.  A strong enough network may mean you don’t need that formula to solve the problem, but you may have to take a few detours to get there.</p>
<p><strong>The best way to explore is to actually face problems.</strong><br>Usually the idea is already reinforced inside my web, but sometimes I missed it entirely.  Studying isn’t as good as testing but it can fix a few broken paths</p>
<h1 id="Summary_of_Holistic_Learning"><strong>Summary of Holistic Learning</strong></h1><p>Holistic learning works with highly conceptual information where there is an underlying system.  It doesn’t work well with arbitrary information or skills.</p>
